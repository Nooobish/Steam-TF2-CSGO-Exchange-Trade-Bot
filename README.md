## Info
This is the bot which I used in past for "Tf2 // CS keys excange". It doesn't work anymore but I hope someone can get some use of this (fix the code and use it). This wasn't made from me personaly (I bough it from a guy (I won't share his name) who gave me full permission to share it with anyone). I'm not responsible for any item lose, bugs or anything related with it. Use it at your own risk.

## Bot fetures:
Buy and sell TF2 and CS-GO Keys

## Commands:
1. !admin -- Gives you the Profile URL of my owner 
2. !suggestprice -- If you think that we should change price then consider about suggesting new one :)
3.!price -- Gives you the prices for every type of trade I can accept 
4.!stock -- Gives you the stock of keys I have at the moment 
5.!shutup -- I won't leave comment after successful trade 
6.!sellcsgo -- If you want to sell CS-GO keys use !sellcsgo # (amount of keys)
7.!buycsgo -- If you want to buy CS-GO keys use !buycsgo # (amount of keys)
